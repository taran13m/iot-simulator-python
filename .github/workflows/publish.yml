name: Publish to PyPI

# Triggered on version tags (v*). The pipeline:
#   1. build    - runs tests, lint, builds sdist + wheel, verifies with twine
#   2. testpypi - publishes to TestPyPI for validation
#   3. pypi     - publishes to production PyPI (requires testpypi to pass)
#
# One-time setup (do this BEFORE the first release):
#
# 1. TestPyPI (https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
#    Add a pending publisher:
#      PyPI project name:  iot-data-simulator
#      Owner:              <your-github-username-or-org>
#      Repository:         iot-simulator-python
#      Workflow name:      publish.yml
#      Environment name:   testpypi
#
# 2. PyPI (https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
#    Add a pending publisher:
#      PyPI project name:  iot-data-simulator
#      Owner:              <your-github-username-or-org>
#      Repository:         iot-simulator-python
#      Workflow name:      publish.yml
#      Environment name:   pypi
#
# 3. GitHub repo Settings > Environments
#    Create two environments: testpypi and pypi.
#    Optionally add deployment protection rules for pypi.
